# Surprise - Representing emotion

The goal of this project is to represent ‘surprise’ emotion. To show about ‘surprise’ emotion, I use Cricut to build a pumpkin in Halloween. And then I cut a star shape for the top of the pumpkin.

## Sculpture

For the sculpture, I use illustrator to cut the shape of eyes, mouse and nose on different piece of sphere and then use glue gun to stick the star shape on top of the sphere. I use Cricut Maker to cut the shape out on color paper. I also use Template Maker website to build the shape of sphere and star. (https://www.templatemaker.nl/en/)

## Issues
* The wires that I used is too long that I need to use glue gun to fasten them.
* The length of the wires is not good enough so that I need to insert them hardly.
* I might use one more piece of sphere to make the pumpkin flatter.
