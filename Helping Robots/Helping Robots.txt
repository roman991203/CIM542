# Cat Helping Tapping Robot – Helping Robots

## Inspiration
For this project, we are going to design a playful interfaces toy. But because of losing kits in classroom and Covid-19, I am struggling at home about how to do this project. And one day when I eat Pringles potato crisps, watching at its logo on brand, I got an idea.

## Introduction
For this toy, it uses photosensors to sense the light in front of tumbler’s eyes. For example, if you put your hand in front of the tumbler, it will make noise to let you know he is very angry and saying “don’t hide me!” or “get away from me!”. And when you let you hand leave, it will become normal. The switch and led is for showing the toy are opening or not. I am going to cut my drawing down and stick it on my 3D model.


## Sculpture
For the Sculpture, I am trying to use Tinkercad to make a 3D model for my tumbler. I draw a simple version on paper at first and based on it I finished the model on Tinkercad.

## Code

I use the blinking system to show the toy is work or not.

## Circuit

* 1 - 220ohm resistors
* 1 – 10Kohm resistors
* 1 - Switch
* 1 - Red LEDs
* 1 - Arduino UNO R3
* 2 - Photosensors
* 1 - Buzzer
* 1 - 9V Power

![photosensors]( https://github.com/roman991203/CIM542/blob/master/Playful%20Interfaces/imgs/photosensor.png)

## Issues
* Maybe I should do more things with my code, for example let photosensor involved in code
* It is hard to put breadboard inside the 3D model
* The photosensors might be not sensitive enough
