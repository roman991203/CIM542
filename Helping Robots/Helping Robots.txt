# Cat Helping Tapping Robot – Helping Robots

## Inspiration
In our daily life, we always use our mobile phones by tapping on the screen. And there are also a lot of games based on tapping. Like Tap Titans and so on. However, it is a hard-working of a lot of tapping on phones and games. So I am trying to do a robot to help us tap on screen quickly to finish the task.

## Introduction
For this Helping Robot, I use four led on cat’s paws in order to show the stage that the robot is in. There are 3 stages of the robot which are closed, opened, high speed. And for how to output tapping on screen, I learn some knowledge about mobile screen and know that we can just use wire with digital output with a foil paper. So I just put the foil paper on the heart part of paw in order to make tap work. The heart part of paw should be electric. We can just use delay to simulate tap and out of the screen. We can just put this robot on the screen to finish the tapping task we want to.


## Sculpture
For the Sculpture, I am trying to use Tinkercad to make a 3D model for my cat paw. I draw a simple version on paper at first and based on it I finished the model on Tinkercad. The heart part of the paw is a little higher than other parts, which makes it can touch the screen and led will not.

## Code

I use the blinking system to show the stage of robot. And use digital input and output to simulate tapping.

## Issues
* The sensitivity between heart part and wire might not be good enough
* This robot might be useless
